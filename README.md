# IPFS Retrieval API

This is a minimal API deployed on an AWS EC2 to enable authorized users to have the machine's IPFS node pull content from the IPFS network for content distribution.

This project is a small part of the larger IPFS-VRBO Capstone project (which is in a private repository, and contains the IPFS logic for the web app).
